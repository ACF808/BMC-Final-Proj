  <h2>Key Mechanisms and Findings (1)</h2>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card" onclick="toggleInfo(0)">
      <h3>Alcohol Metabolism & Toxic Byproducts</h3>
        <ul class="hidden margin">
          <li>Alcohol is primarily metabolized in the liver via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS), especially Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1).</li>
          <li>Chronic alcohol consumption induces CYP2E1, which generates large amounts of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).</li>
          <li>The primary toxic metabolites are acetaldehyde and ROS, which are responsible for most cellular damage.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" onclick="toggleInfo(1)">
      <h3>Central Role of Mitochondrial Damage</h3>
        <ul class="hidden margin">
          <li>Structural Damage: Causes mitochondrial swelling, loss of membrane potential, and abnormal opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP).</li>
          <li>
            Functional Impairment:
            <ul class="second">
              <li>Inhibits key enzymes in the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation (e.g., by depleting NAD⁺).</li>
              <li>Impairs Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complexes (especially I and III), leading to further ROS production and a vicious cycle.</li>
              <li>Reduces ATP synthesis, causing cellular energy crisis.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Induction of Apoptosis: Triggers the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by releasing pro-apoptotic factors like cytochrome c, activating caspase enzymes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" onclick="toggleInfo(2)">
      <h3>Overall Cellular Consequences</h3>
        <ul class="hidden margin">
          <li>Oxidative Stress: An imbalance between excessive ROS production and depleted antioxidant defenses (e.g., glutathione).</li>
          <li>Lipid Peroxidation: ROS attack cell and mitochondrial membranes.</li>
          <li>Inflammation & Cell Death: The cumulative damage triggers inflammatory responses and leads to necrotic or apoptotic cell death.</li>
          <li>Organ Damage: These processes underpin the pathology in key organs like the liver, brain, and heart.</li>

  <h2>General Impact of Alcohol Misuse (Chronic and Heavy) (2)</h2>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Increased Risk of Infection</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Excessive chronic alcohol consumption impairs the cellular mechanisms 
        responsible for clearing pathogens and repairing tissue, leading to an 
        increased susceptibility to infections (like pneumonia and tuberculosis) 
        and delayed wound healing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Impaired Immune Cell Function</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Chronic misuse impairs the ability of critical immune cells to regulate 
        inflammation and metabolism, contributing to widespread multiorgan dysfunction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Systemic Inflammation</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        While acute (short-term) alcohol exposure can temporarily dampen some immune 
        responses, chronic alcohol consumption often results in a state of systemic 
        hyper-inflammation (heightened general inflammation), coupled paradoxically 
        with a compromised ability to fight microbial threats.

  <h2>Organ Specific (2)</h2>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card" onclick="toggleInfo(6)">
      <h3>Gut and Liver</h3>
      <ul class="hidden margin">
        <li>
          Alcohol severely compromises gut and liver immunity, 
          causing changes in the microbial community (dysbiosis) 
          and leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction. 
          This allows bacterial products to "leak" into the bloodstream, 
          triggering widespread inflammation in organs like the liver and brain.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" onclick="toggleInfo(7)">
      <h3>Lungs</h3>
      <ul class="hidden margin">
        <li>
          Alcohol abuse significantly compromises pulmonary immunity, 
          making individuals more vulnerable to lung infections. 
          It interferes with the function of key cells, such as:

      <h3>Brain (Neuroinflammation)</h3>
      <ul class="hidden margin">
        <li>
          Excessive alcohol can induce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, 
          in part by activating immune cells in the brain (microglia).

      <h3>Neutrophils</h3>

      <h3>Autoimmune Protection</h3>
        <ul class="margin">
          <li>
            Research has shown a paradoxical association where alcohol consumption has been linked to a 
            protective factor against the development of some autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, 
            systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis, although the exact mechanisms are complex 
            and relate to its effect on certain immune cells and metabolites.

  <h2>Pattern-Dependent Effects on the Innate Immune system (3)</h2>
  <p> The innate immune system (the body's first, non-specific line 
    of defense) responds differently depending on how alcohol is consumed:
  </p>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Acute Alcohol Exposure (Short-term/Binge):</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Generally leads to immunosuppression, actively inhibiting 
        inflammatory responses and interfering with key immune processes. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chronic Alcohol Exposure (Long-term/Heavy):</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Tends to accelerate inflammatory responses (proinflammatory effects). 
        This chronic inflammation is a major factor in diseases like alcoholic 
        liver disease and pancreatitis.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="impair">
  <h2>Impairment of Key Immune Cells (3)</h2>
  <p>
    Chronic alcohol exposure interferes with the normal functioning of 
    almost all immune cells: 
  </p>
  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Monocytes/Macrophages:</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Alcohol impairs their ability to fight pathogens, but at the same time, 
        it can promote a shift in macrophage types that contributes to liver injury.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Neutrophils:</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Alcohol increases the production of harmful molecules 
        (Reactive Oxygen Species or ROS) by neutrophils, but it decreases 
        their phagocytic capacity, which is crucial for killing bacteria.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs):</h3>
      <p class="margin">
        Alcohol inhibits the function of 
        APCs (like dendritic cells and monocytes), which are necessary to 
        initiate the adaptive (specific) immune response.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="Enhanced">
  <h2>Enhanced Susceptibility to Infections (3)</h2>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <ul class="margin">
        The overall result of chronic alcohol consumption is a state of subclinical 
        immunosuppression that becomes clinically significant upon a secondary challenge 
        (e.g., infection). 
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <ul class="margin">
        Chronic alcoholics are considered immunocompromised hosts, leading to: 
        Increased susceptibility to both bacterial (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia) 
        and viral infections (e.g., HCV, HIV). 
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <p class="margin">
        Impaired Antiviral Response: Alcohol inhibits the induction and signaling of 
        Type-I interferons, which are critical molecules for defending against viral 
        infections.
      </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="Enhanced">
  <h2>Adaptive Immunity Damage (3)</h2>
  <p>Chronic alcohol interferes with the body's specific, long-term defense system:</p>

  <div class="card-grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>T-Cell Imbalance:</h3>
      <ul class="margin">
        Chronic alcoholics have impaired T-cell responses and a shift in the balance 
        of helper T cells (Th1/Th2) toward a predominance of Th2-type responses.
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Humoral Response Alterations:</h3>
      <ul class="margin">
        There is an observed increase in the antibody IgA and a relative decrease in 
        IgG antibodies, further compromising specific host defenses.
